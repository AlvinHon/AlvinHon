## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This guy likes coding. Sometimes he implements the ideas from the research topics that he is interested in. He can produce example code for demonstrative projects which can be a reference for future development. When inspired by something, he will try to make it real. 

Let's see some highlighted repositories here.
